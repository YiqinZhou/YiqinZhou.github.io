I think Devilish version is interesting because by scrolling, players get a sense of achievement. It is also more fun and exciting as players continuously face slightly different game scenes. 
For my own design, I plan to do the followings:
•	Levels: for the first level, with 30 blocks lined up regularly (high possibility of bounces), only a few purple blocks. For the second level, with 40 blocks scatter around, more purple blocks. For the third level, with 60 blocks, some are very low, with a great number of purple blocks.
•	Paddles: When the score reaches 100, speeding up the longer it moves in the same direction; when the score reaches 200, "catching" the ball when it hits the paddle and releasing it at a later time when the ‘shift’ is pressed; when the score reaches 300, paddles can also be moved up and down.
•	Blocks: white blocks are the basic blocks which players can clear with one bounce. Purple blocks are the blocks which players have to hit more than once (use a random number between 2 and 5). Pink blocks are the blocks which players need to bounce more than once, but after they are cleared, power ups drop. 
•	Power ups: Power up 1 can increase the length of the paddle. Power Up 2 can slow down the speed of the ball. The magic color can change some purple blocks to white blocks for 1 minute.
•	When players press 1-3, clear the current level and jump to the level corresponding to the number pressed. When players press the ‘L’ key, recover to three lives. When players press the ‘S’ key, ball motion becomes slower. Press the ‘P’ key to get power ups. Press the ‘P’ once to get the speed boomer. Press the ‘P’ consecutively twice to get the bomb. Press the ‘P’ consecutively three times to get the magic color. 
•	Extra substantial difference: players have the freedom to choose a ball from different balls at the start of the game. Some balls are fast but big, some balls are slow but small etc. Balls also have different lives attached and different images. This customization give players more freedom.
