My solutions and comments for this problem are below.
-----------------------------------------------------
a) As shown in the code section. The algorithm is looking at every stop codon
   and a previous stop codon in the same ORF. Then find the first start codon
   during this part of sequence.

b) By passing in different parameters (10,40 and 70 for "min_length_aa" respectively),
   I get the number of ORFs as 199,47,16 respectively. I know the number of ORFs will 
   get smaller and smaller as the amino acids length get longer because some shorter
   ORFs do not fulfill the minimum length requirement and have to be removed.  
   
c) The average lengths for 10, 40 and 70 minimum are 73.90, 250.85 and 637.94 respectively.
   The average lengths for 70 is significantly higher because the ORFs that satisfy the minimum
   are rare and they are usually extremely long. Before I compute, I will expect the number getting
   higher and higher because the minimal length increases. 

d) Generally, the ORFs I have found roughly match up with those depicted in the map. Especially for the 
   unknowns, they exactly match up because the calculation of unknowns are exactly the same as my calculation.
   Discrepancies do exist. For example, for Replicase 1A, the map shows 265-13398, while my result shows 265-23149.
   Also for Replicase 1B, the map shows from 13398 to 21485, my result is 13599 to 21485.  

e) In the long run,
