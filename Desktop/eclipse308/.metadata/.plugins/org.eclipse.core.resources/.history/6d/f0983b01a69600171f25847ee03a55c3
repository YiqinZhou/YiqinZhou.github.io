First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2017
This project is done by myself. I started this project on Sept 1, finished on Sept 10. The number of hours worked was around 20 hours. I checked oracle for some functions. The complete project function is introduced as below:


•	Levels: 3 Levels are mainly differentiated by the number of blocks. The configuration of the blocks is an array such as [1,2,3,2,1,1] (1 meaning type 1 block).
•	Paddles: When the score reaches 100, speeding up the longer it moves in the same direction; when the score reaches 200, "catching" the ball when it hits the paddle and releasing it at a later time when the ‘R’ is pressed; when the score reaches 300, paddles can also be moved up and down.
•	Blocks: blocks type 1 are the basic blocks which players can clear with one bounce. blocks type 2 are the blocks which players have to hit more than once, each time opacity changes. blocks type 3 are the blocks which after they are cleared, power ups drop. 
•	Power ups: Type 1 power up can increase the speed of ball movement. Type 2 power up increase the length of the paddle. Type 3 power up can increase the size of the ball.
•	Cheat keys: When players press 'W', clear the current level and jump to the win page. When players press the ‘L’ key, recover to three lives. 
•	Extra substantial difference: players have the freedom to choose a ball from different balls at the start of the game. Some balls are fast but big, some balls are slow but small etc. Balls also have different lives attached and different images. This customization give players more freedom.
