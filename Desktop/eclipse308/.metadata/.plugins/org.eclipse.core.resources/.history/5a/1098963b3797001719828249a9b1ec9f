My solutions and comments for this problem are below.
-----------------------------------------------------
a) The location for the beginning of the code is stored in the variable 'beginning' 
   and the location for the end of the code is stored in the variable 'end'.
   The length of the Cdc24 gene is 3565-1001+1=2565. (Stored in the variable 'length_of_gene') .
   The length of Cdc24's peptide product is (2565-3)/3=854 (Stored in the variable 'length_of_peptide_product')
   because every triple will translate into one amino acid, 
   but we need to exclude the stop codon because it will not have corresponding amino acid but just stop.
   The function of this protein is: Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42p; it is required for polarity establishment and maintenance.
   
b) Yes, the actual sequence which is recognized by each enzyme is reported

c) Integrating plasmids can integrate into the host chromosome. A plasmid is a small, circular, double-stranded DNA
   molecule that is distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA. Often the genes carried in plasmids provide cell with
   genetic advantages.
