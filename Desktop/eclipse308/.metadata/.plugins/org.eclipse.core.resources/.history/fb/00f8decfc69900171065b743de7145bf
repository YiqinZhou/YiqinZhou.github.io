My solutions and comments for this problem are below.
-----------------------------------------------------
a) I could put all reads into dictionary. Start the assembly from a random read (it does not matter
   which reas since it is circular) and check the last 20 nucleotides and find the match with another read's first 20.
   Once the next read is found, this read is removed from the dictionary. Therefore, I don't need to 
   know the length of dictionary. Just set a while loop with condition len(dict)>0. The challenging part is to
   loop through the dictionary and find the next read that matches. To deal with those potential obstacles,
   I can set up a while loop so that it can keep checking every read, finding the match. Also, the algorithm
   needs to deal with the overlapping. The code needs not be changed for the number of reads and the average
   read length. For my current code, it needs to change when the degree of reads overlap changes. But it is 
   easy to deal with this, just pass the overlap number as a parameter to a function (I am not doing this
   because I did not set up part b) as a separate function. Instead, I put the code inside the main).  
 
b)  This length makes sense. The original total length is 8821, there are 14 overlaps because it is circular.
    each overlap is 20 nucleotides long. Thus, the assembly length should be 8821-14*20=8541.
    
c) I find 27 ORFs. Their lengths in amino acids are: 48, 838, 103, 67, 66, 49, 57, 55, 52, 42, 40, 88, 56, 
   49, 192, 368, 101, 40, 58, 42, 66, 56, 43, 286, 44, 51, 50. Longest length is 838 amino acids long.
