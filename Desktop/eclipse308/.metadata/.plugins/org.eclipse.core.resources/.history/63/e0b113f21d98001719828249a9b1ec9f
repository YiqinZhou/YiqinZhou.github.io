### Conclusions


Design Review
=======

### Status

* Bullets are made with asterisks

1. You can order things with numbers.

### Design

You can put blocks of code in here like this:
```java
    /**
     * Returns sum of all values in given list.
     */
    public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int d : data) {
            total += d;
        }
        return total;
    }
```
