My solutions and comments for this problem are below.
-----------------------------------------------------
a) As shown in the code section. The algorithm is looking at every stop codon
   and a previous stop codon in the same ORF. Then find the first start codon
   during this part of sequence.

b) By passing in different parameters (10,40 and 70 for "min_length_aa" respectively),
   I get the number of ORFs as 199,47,16 respectively. I know the number of ORFs will 
   get smaller and smaller as the amino acids length get longer because some shorter
   ORFs do not fulfill the minimum length requirement and have to be removed. 
   
c)
